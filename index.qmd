::: {#hero-heading}
**The core activities of MuViSU are three-fold:**

-   To extend multi-dimensional visualisation methodology and related
    techniques, such as biplots, through theoretical developments;

-   The application of newly derived techniques to data sets originating
    from various fields;

-   The development, maintenance, and improvement of an extensive
    collection of R functions for constructing all necessary graphical
    displays and performing various multi-dimensional visualisation
    based techniques.

**Vision**

To make multi-dimensional visualisation methodologies relevant and
accessible by empowering practitioners and researchers of varying skills
to apply these visualisations widely in data exploration, especially in
the current era of big data.

**Mission**

To advance the practice, application and research in the visualisation
of multi-dimensional data. This will be done through establishing
collaborative networks, developing software and high-quality
peer-reviewed research outputs.
